## SolidWorks Files
All of the CAD files associated with this project are in the [CAD folder](https://github.com/BrianBock/ENAE788x_Project/tree/main/CAD).The main Solidworks assembly is `rover.sldasm`. This file contains the completed/finalized rover, comprised of several rover subassemblies (`front_chassis_assembly`, `rear_chassis_assembly`, `sensor_arch`, `seat_and_restraint`) and the life support payload, as well as several obstacles, Z2 astronauts, and "Lego" astronauts. The easiest way to navigate this collection of files is to start at the `rover.sldasm` file and navigate through the part tree, selecting and opening whichever subassembly (or subsubassembly) you wish to take a closer look at. 

There are some SketchUp models in this folder as well, which are mostly sketches and concept drafts. If you want to view these, you'll need to download [Sketchup Make 2017](https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions) or later. 

### Wheels and Suspension
There is a separate wheel/suspension subassembly for each wheel (FR, FL, RR, RL). The left and right assemblies ((FR, FL), & (RR, RL)) are identical in nearly every way, differing only in a unique spring, whose length is a function of the that wheel's wishbone positions. The front and rear suspensions differ only in the way they mate to the assembly. The front two wheels have a cylindrical mate (placeholder for a steering motor), while the rear two wheels (which do not turn) mate via a rectangular prism. They all share the same wishbone, motor, motor hub, mudguard, and wheel files. You can manually adjust the position of a wheel (up/down) in either the rear or front chassis subassembly, and the spring inside will correspondingly compress or stretch (after you rebuild the document).
